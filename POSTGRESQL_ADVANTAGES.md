# Why PostgreSQL? 🐘

## Advantages of This PostgreSQL Version

### 🎯 Production-Ready

Unlike SQLite (file-based database), PostgreSQL is designed for production use:

| Feature | SQLite (Old Version) | PostgreSQL (This Version) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Concurrent Users** | Limited (file locking) | Excellent (handles 100+ users) |
| **Performance** | Good for small data | Excellent for large datasets |
| **Data Integrity** | Basic | ACID compliant |
| **Scalability** | Limited | Highly scalable |
| **Deployment** | File-based, single user | Client-server, multi-user |
| **Backups** | Copy file | Professional backup tools |
| **Production Use** | Not recommended | Industry standard |

### ✅ No Compilation Issues

**Problem with SQLite versions:**
- `better-sqlite3` requires C++ build tools
